Figure out when a photo was taken

This is a webservice to be deployed by or on-behalf of museums or anyone else with a large collection of historic photos which they lack sufficient metadata on. This project in particular focuses on the question of when a photo was taken, which it flexibly handles by allowing photos to be grouped into easier to date "albums".

It is developed using Django, and can be developed and deployed like any Django app.
